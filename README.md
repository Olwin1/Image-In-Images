## Image in images
A simple program to replace every pixel of an image with another whole image making an image made of smaller images.
To use just replace the "larger_image.png" file with a png of the image that you want to have smaller images be made of and the "smaller_image.png" with the small images you want to use.
Do not use large images I recommend max of around 300px for larger image and 100px for smaller image as this takes a while to generate and every single pixel in the larger image will be replaced with the number of pixels in the smaller image.
